        Let me introduce you to the baddest musical entertainer who ever lived... Prince.
        He played multiple more instruments than you, fucked more women than you, and was richer than you. What are you doing with your life. Through the fires and flames of a broken home, he made it through the ranks to be a querky real life giant.
